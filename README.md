# no-cors-chrome

This is a custom applescript that launches Google Chrome with web security disabled.  This is useful when blocked by CORS issues
or you need to connect to Chrome for debugging with an IDE such as VSCode.

*Warning* This does disable many browser security features, so you should only use it when absolutely needed.  This is not meant for regular non-development use.
